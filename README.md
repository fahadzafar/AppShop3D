#Goal of the App:
Allows users to customize 3D models, then place an order for a 3D print and pay through the app. The 3rd party 3D printing service will ship it to the customer. The information is passed through the app.

#Description:
We always want to put our own personal touch on things, so why cant we do it with collectible, miniatures and figures ? Well now you can. Select a collectible that you like, and color is the way you want. Enhance their features or make them look weird. That's the fun part. Then simply order it and we will ship it to your doorstep to treasure it forever and to share it with friends and family. Make an entire fleet of spaceships or get your own orc that is "not green", or even a "zombie" with an orange skin. You can do all that all that with Shop3D, a simple and easy way to cast your creativity on collectibles.
